//! # Image widgets with multiple graphics protocol backends for [ratatui]
//!
//! [ratatui] is an immediate-mode TUI library.
//! ratatui-image tackles 3 general problems when rendering images with an immediate-mode TUI:
//!
//! **Query the terminal for available graphics protocols**
//!
//! Some terminals may implement one or more graphics protocols, such as Sixels, or the iTerm2 or
//! Kitty graphics protocols. Guess by env vars. If that fails, query the terminal with some
//! control sequences.
//! Fallback to "halfblocks" which uses some unicode half-block characters with fore- and
//! background colors.
//!
//! **Query the terminal for the font-size in pixels.**
//!
//! If there is an actual graphics protocol available, it is necessary to know the font-size to
//! be able to map the image pixels to character cell area. The image can be resized, fit, or
//! cropped to an area. Query the terminal for the window and columns/rows sizes, and derive the
//! font-size.
//!
//! **Render the image by the means of the guessed protocol.**
//!
//! Some protocols, like Sixels, are essentially "immediate-mode", but we still need to avoid the
//! TUI from overwriting the image area, even with blank characters.
//! Other protocols, like Kitty, are essentially stateful, but at least provide a way to re-render
//! an image that has been loaded, at a different or same position.
//! Since we have the font-size in pixels, we can precisely map the characters/cells/rows-columns that
//! will be covered by the image and skip drawing over the image.
//!
//! # Quick start
//! ```rust
//! use ratatui::{backend::TestBackend, Terminal, Frame};
//! use ratatui_image::{picker::Picker, StatefulImage, protocol::StatefulProtocol};
//!
//! struct App {
//!     // We need to hold the render state.
//!     image: StatefulProtocol,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let backend = TestBackend::new(80, 30);
//!     let mut terminal = Terminal::new(backend)?;
//!
//!     // Should use Picker::from_query_stdio() to get the font size and protocol,
//!     // but we can't put that here because that would break doctests!
//!     let mut picker = Picker::from_fontsize((8, 12));
//!
//!     // Load an image with the image crate.
//!     let dyn_img = image::ImageReader::open("./assets/Ada.png")?.decode()?;
//!
//!     // Create the Protocol which will be used by the widget.
//!     let image = picker.new_resize_protocol(dyn_img);
//!
//!     let mut app = App { image };
//!
//!     // This would be your typical `loop {` in a real app:
//!     terminal.draw(|f| ui(f, &mut app))?;
//!     // It is recommended to handle the encoding result
//!     app.image.last_encoding_result().unwrap()?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! fn ui(f: &mut Frame<'_>, app: &mut App) {
//!     // The image widget.
//!     let image = StatefulImage::default();
//!     // Render with the protocol state.
//!     f.render_stateful_widget(image, f.area(), &mut app.image);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [picker::Picker] helper is there to do all this font-size and graphics-protocol guessing,
//! and also to map character-cell-size to pixel size so that we can e.g. "fit" an image inside
//! a desired columns+rows bound, and so on.
//!
//! # Widget choice
//! * The [Image] widget does not adapt to rendering area (except not drawing at all if space
//!   is insufficient), may be a bit more bug prone (overdrawing or artifacts), and is not friendly
//!   with some of the protocols (e.g. the Kitty graphics protocol, which is stateful). Its big
//!   upside is that it is _stateless_ (in terms of ratatui, i.e. immediate-mode), and thus can never
//!   block the rendering thread/task. A lot of ratatui apps only use stateless widgets.
//! * The [StatefulImage] widget adapts to its render area, is more robust against overdraw bugs and
//!   artifacts, and plays nicer with some of the graphics protocols.
//!   The resizing and encoding is blocking by default, but it is possible to offload this to another
//!   thread or async task (see `examples/async.rs`). It must be rendered with
//!   [`render_stateful_widget`] (i.e. with some mutable state).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! * `examples/demo.rs` is a fully fledged demo.
//! * `examples/async.rs` shows how to offload resize and encoding to another thread, to avoid
//!   blocking the UI thread.
//!
//! The lib also includes a binary that renders an image file, but it is focused on testing.
//!
//! # Features
//! * `crossterm` or `termion` should match your ratatui backend. `termwiz` is available, but not
//!   working correctly with ratatu-image.
//! * `serde` for `#[derive]`s on [picker::ProtocolType] for convenience, because it might be
//!   useful to save it in some user configuration.
//! * `image-defaults` (default) just enables `image/defaults` (`image` has `default-features =
//! false`). To only support a selection of image formats and cut down dependencies, disable this
//!   feature, add `image` to your crate, and enable its features/formats as desired. See
//!   https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-unification.
